> This is an TM4C123x Baremetal Software to toggle an LED using GPIOF-PIN(3).
> All {*.h, *.c, *.s, *.ld & make} files were created and designed by myself.
> The Software was cross-compiled using ARM-GNU Cross-Toolchain v13.2.Release1.
> The Software was debugged, tested and verified using Keil uVision in which TExaS plugins were used to visualise GPIO-PORT(F).
> A Simulation was done on Keil uVision for validation, and was recorded.
