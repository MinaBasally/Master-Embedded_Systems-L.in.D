> I designed this Software to implement a type of Linear Data Structures known as "Last In, First Out", or "LIFO" for short.
> All {*.h & *.c} files were created and designed by myself.
> The APIs included in the software are :
	#	LIFO_Buff_Status LIFO_Buff_init
	#	LIFO_Buff_Status LIFO_Buff_push
	#	LIFO_Buff_Status LIFO_Buff_pop
	#	LIFO_Buff_print
> The Software was developed using Eclipse-IDE and was auto built using MinGW GCC Toolchain.
> The Software was debugged using Eclipse-IDE.
> The Software was tested, verified and validated by a simple application(LIFO.exe).
