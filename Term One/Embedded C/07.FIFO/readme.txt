> I designed this Software to implement a type of Linear Data Structures known as "First In, First Out", or "Circular FIFO" for short.
> All {*.h & *.c} files were created and designed by myself.
> The APIs included in the software are :
	#	FIFO_Buff_Status FIFO_Buff_init
	#	FIFO_Buff_Status FIFO_Buff_push
	#	FIFO_Buff_Status FIFO_Buff_pop
	#	FIFO_Buff_print
> The Software was developed using Eclipse-IDE and was auto built using MinGW GCC Toolchain.
> The Software was debugged using Eclipse-IDE.
> The Software was tested, verified and validated by a simple application(FIFO.exe).
