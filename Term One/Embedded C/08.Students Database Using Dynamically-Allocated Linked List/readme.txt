> This Software is a Student Management System(Student Information System).
> The Software creates a Students Database in the form of a Dynamically-Allocated Linked list.
> All {*.h & *.c} files were created and designed by myself.
> The Software was developed using Eclipse-IDE and was auto built using MinGW GCC Toolchain.


> The Student Management System includes the following APIs :

	### 1. AddStudent()
 API Function: /* Add students manually */

	### 2. DeleteStudent()
 API Function: /* Find students by Their IDs and Delete them */

	### 3. ShowEntireList()
 API Function: /* Print All The Data */

	### 4. DeleteAll()
 API Function: /* Delete All The Data */

	### 5. GetNth()
 API Function: /* Find students by Their List Numbers and Print them */

	### 6. GetLength_iterative()
 API Function: /* Find The Total Number of students using an Iterative Method and Print it */

	### 7. GetLength_recursive(* )
 API Function: /* Find The Total Number of students using a Recursive Method and Print it */

	### 9. GetNthFromTheEnd()
 API Function: /* Find students by Their Numbers from The List End and Print them */

	### 10. GetTheMiddleNode()
 API Function: /* Print The Student in The Middle of the list */

	### 11. DetectLoop()
