> In this project; it is required to design a Pressure Monitoring System.
> A comprehensive, detailed, step-by-step system design process was carried out in a scientific approach.
> Different UML Diagrams were used to clearly describe the system and subsystems.
> TTool was used for a complete modeling and verification of the system.
> The STM32F103C6 Baremetal Software receives a signal representing the value of the cabin pressure from a Pressure Sensor, and accordingly it gives a visual alert if the pressure is above a preset threshold(Turns ON an LED).
> All {*.h, *.c, *.s, *.ld & make} files were created and designed by myself.
> The Software was cross-compiled using ARM-GNU Cross-Toolchain v13.2.Release1.
> For testing and validating the software; a simulation was done on Proteus, and was recorded.
