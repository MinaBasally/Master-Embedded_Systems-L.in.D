> This is an STM32F103C6 Baremetal Software to toggle GPIOA->pin13 whenever the core receives a specific external interrupt signal from the External Interrupt Controller(EXTI).
> All {*.h & *.c} files were created and designed by myself.
> The Software was developed using STM32Cube-IDE and was auto built using ARM-GNU Cross-Toolchain v13.2.Release1.
> The Software was debugged, tested and verified using Keil uVision.
> A Simulation was done on Keil uVision, and was recorded.
