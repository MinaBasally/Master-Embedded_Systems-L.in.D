> This is an STM32F103C6 Baremetal Software to toggle GPIOB->pin1 & GPIOB->pin13 using two push-buttons conntected to GPIOA->pin1 & GPIOA->pin13.
> Both input pins are configured as Floating Inputs, while both output pins are configured as Push-Pull Outputs.
> All {*.h & *.c} files were created and designed by myself.
> The Software was developed using STM32Cube-IDE and was auto built using ARM-GNU Cross-Toolchain v13.2.Release1.
> The Software was debugged, tested and verified using Keil uVision.
> A Simulation was done on Keil uVision, and was recorded.
> A Proteus Project was also created to test and verify the software.
