> This is an ATmega32 Baremetal Software to implement a 2-digit Stopwatch using two 7-Segment Displays, two nMOS Transistors and a 7-Segment Decoder.
> The two nMOS Transistors are used for selecting either 7-Segment Display, and are connected to I/O (PC2,PC3).
> The 4 input pins of the 7-Segment Decoder are connected to I/O (PC4,PC5,PC6,PC7).
> A Push Button is connected to the "RESET" pin to reset the ATmega32.
> All {*.c & *.h} files were created and designed by myself.
> The Software was developed using Atmel Studio and was auto built using AVR 8-bit GNU Cross-Toolchain (3.6.2.1778).
> The Software was debugged, tested and verified using Proteus.
> A Simulation was done on Proteus, and was recorded.
